4.Fetch and preprocess the data as required using Pandas package.

Time taken to complete the task

Coding/Scripting - 1hr
Documentation - 1 hr

Alternative approaches explored

1.Apify - It allows to scrap google trends data but it is a paid software.
2.Autoscraper - It allows to scrap data from google trends webpage but it is static and is not reliable as we need to change the HTML tags if there are changes in the webpage.

Reason for choosing Pytrends

1.It is an open source library.
2.It can be used for writing generic code.
3.Easy to retrieve data and well documented package.

Code Execution

1.Install Jupyter Notebook in your system.
2.Import the given .ipynb file into the Jupyter Notebook.
3.Execute the code cells to check the expected results.
4.Check the data by generating graph plots for the data in the given file.
5.Check the .csv file for the collected results.
