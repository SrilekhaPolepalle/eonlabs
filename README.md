## Alternative approaches explored

1.Apify - It allows to scrap google trends data but it is a paid software.

2.Autoscraper - It allows to scrap data from google trends webpage but it is static and is not reliable as we need to change the HTML tags if there are changes in the webpage.

1.It is an open source library.

2.It can be used for writing generic code.

3.Easy to retrieve data and well documented package.
